1. Docker tool box

  • Oracle VirtualBox
  • Docker Engine
  • Docker Machine
  • Docker Compose
  • Kitematic GUI

  Supports 64 bit OS, Windows 7 or higher and virtualization is enabled

  This is legacy

2. Docker Desktop for windows

In this we remove Oracle virtualnox and use microsoft native virtualization technology available with windows called Microsoft Hyper-V

Because of dependency on Hyper-V , this is supported only for Windows 10 enterprise or professional edition and on Windows server 2016 , because both these operating systems comes with Hyper-V support by default.


3. *** Note : Both Docker toolbox and Docker Desktop for Windows will help run a linux container on a windows host. This does not include windows applications or windows images or windows containers.

With Windows server 2016 , microsoft announced support for Windows Container for the first time. You can now package applications , Windows applications into Windows docker containers and run them on Windows docker host using  Docker desktops for windows

4. When you install Docker Desktop for Windows , Default option is for Linux containers.You must explicitly configure Docker to switch to Windows containers if you would like to use Windows containers.

5. Unlike Linux ,  there are two types of containers in windows

a) A windows server container which works exactly like linux containers where the OS kernel is shred with the underlying OS

b) To allow better security boundary between containers and to allow kernels with different versions and configuration co-exist, hype-v isolation was introduced.

In Hyper-V isolation each container is run within a highly optimized virtual machine guaranteeing complete kernel isolation between the containers and the underlying host.

Unlike linux world where we have different options to specify like Ubuntu,fedora,centos etc , in windows we have two options only

• Windows Server Core
• Nano server

A nano server is a headless deployment option for windows server which runs at a fraction of size of the full operating system

Windows server core is not a light as you might expected it to be .

*** Note : VirtualBox and Hyper-V cannot coexist together on the same machine.
