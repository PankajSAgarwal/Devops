1. Container Orchestration

It is a solution that consists of a set of tools and scripts that can help host containers in a production environment.

Typically a container orchestration solution consists of multiple Docker hosts that can host containers

docker service create --replicas=100 nodejs

Container orchestration allows you to deploy hundreds or thousands instances of your application with a single command.

Some orchestration technology  automatically scale up number of instances when users increase and scale down the number of instances when the demand decreases.
Some solutions can even help in automatically add additional hosts to support the user load.

Not just clustering and scaling the container orchestartion solutions, also provide support for advanced networking between containers across different hosts as well as load balancing users request across different hosts.
They also provide support for sharing storage between different hosts as well as support for configuration management and security within the cluster.
