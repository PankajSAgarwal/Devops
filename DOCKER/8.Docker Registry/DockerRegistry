6. Deploy private registry

How to deploy your own private repository within your organization

The docker registry in itself is another application and is available as a docker image , the name of the image is "registry" and it exposes the API on port 5000 . 

-> Run your private registry at port 5000 

• docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2

-> Now that you have your custom registry running at docker host port 5000 , how do u push your own image to it?

• docker image tag my-image localhost:5000/my-image

-> push the docker image to local private repository

docker push localhost:5000/my-image

-> pulll the image

docker pull localhost:5000/my-image

        OR
docker pull 192.168.56.100:5000/my-image
