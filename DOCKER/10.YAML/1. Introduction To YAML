1. A YAML file is used to represent data
2. Repesentation of data in XML , JSON and YAML


XML:

<Servers>
  <Server>
    <name>Server1</name>
    <owner>John</owner>
    <created>12232012</created>
    <Status>Active</Status>
  </Server>
</Servers>

JSON:

{
  Servers: [
    {
      name: Server1,
      owner: John,
      created: 12232012,
      status: Active
    }
  ]
}

YAML

Servers :
  -     name: Server1
        owner: John
        created: 12232012
        status: Active

3. Key value pair in YAML

Fruit: Apple
Vegetable: Carrot
Liquid: Water
Meat: Chicken

Note : a space is required in between key and value pair .

4. Array/Lists

Fruits:
- Orange
- Apple
- Banana

Vegetables:
- Carrot
- Cauliflower
- Tomato

Dash(-) indicates it is an element of an array

5. Dictionary

- is a set of properties grouped together under an item

Banana:
   Calories: 1
   Fat: 0.4 g
   Carbs: 27 g

Grapes:
   Calories: 62
   Fat: 0.3 g
   Carbs: 16 g

Notice the blank space before each item.
You must have equal number of blank spaces before the properties of a single item, so they are all aligned together

6.Blank spaces in YAML

a) 
Banana:
   Calories: 1
   Fat: 0.4 g
   Carbs: 27 g

The example above indicates Calories,Fat and Carbs are properties of Banana

b) 

Banana:
   Calories: 105
    Fat: 0.4 g
    Carbs: 27 g

This format indicates Calories is a property of banana but Fat and Carbs are properties of calories(which doesnt make sense)

This will also give a syntax error which will indicate mapping values are not allowed here as Calories is already set to a value 105.

You can either set a direct value or a hash map but not both.

** Note: Number of spaces before each property is key in YAML

7. You can have list containing dictionary containing lists.

Fruits:
  - Banana:
      Calories: 105
      Fat: 0.4 g
      Carbs: 27 g
  
  - Grape:
      Calories: 62
      Fat: 0.3 g
      Carbs: 16 g

In this case i have a list of fruits and elements of the list are banana and grapes. But each of these elements are further dictionaries containing nutrition information.

8. Dictionary vs List vs List of dictionaries

-> To store different properties of a single object , we use dictionary
e.g a car can have properties like Color,price, Transmission,Model

Dictionary

Color: Blue
Model: Corvertte
Transmission: Manual
Price: $20,000

-> If we need to split model with name and year then we can have dictionary within another dictionary

Dictionary within a dictionary

Color: Blue
Model: 
  Name: Corvertte
  Year: 1995
Transmission: Manual
Price: $20,000

-> Let say we would like to store the names of 6 cars . The names are formed by the color and the model of the car

List

- Blue Corvertte
- Grey Corvertte
- Red Corvertte
- Green Corvertte
- Blue Corvertte
- Black Corvertte

List of dictionaries

- Color: Blue
  Model:
    Name: Corvertte
    Year: 1995
  Transmission: Manual
  Price: $20,000

- Color: Grey
  Model:
    Name: Corvertte
    Year: 1995
  Transmission: Manual
  Price: $10,000

- Color: Blue
  Model:
    Name: Corvertte
    Year: 1995
  Transmission: Manual
  Price: $12,000

9. Dictionary is an un-ordered collection whereas list is an ordered collection

Dictionary 1                                    Dictionary 2

Banana:                                           Banana:
  Calories: 105                                     Calories: 105
  Fat: 0.4 g                                        Carbs: 27 g
  Carbs: 27 g                                       Fat: 0.4 g

Both dictionaries are same even if dictionary 2 has order of Fat and carb changed . As longs as all properties value match of two dictionaries , dictionary is considered equal even if order of property is changed.

Arrays/List

List 1                                                      List 2

#List of fruits                                           #List of fruits

Fruits:                                                     Fruits:  
  - Orange                                                    - Orange
  - Apple                                                     - Apple
  - Banana                                                    - Banana

  The baove two list are not same as in a list order matters

10. # is the comment character in a YAML file.
