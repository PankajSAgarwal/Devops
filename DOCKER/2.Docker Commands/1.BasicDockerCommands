1. The docker run command is used to run a container from an image.

e.g docker run nginx

it will run an instance of the nginx application on the docker host if it already exists.

If the image is not present on the host , it will go out to the docker hub and pull the image down.But this is only done first time . For the subsequent executions , the same image will be reused.

2. ps - list containers

docker ps command list all running containers and some basic information about them such as the container id , the name of the image we used to run the containers, the current status and the name of the container.Each container gets a random ID and name created for it by docker .

e.g docker ps

3. To see all containers running or not

docker ps -a outputs all running as well as previously stopped or exited containers.

e.g docker ps -a

4. To stop a container , use docker stop command but you must provide either the container ID or the container name.If you are not sure of the name run the docker ps command.

On succes of docker stop command you will see the name printed out and running docker ps again will show no running container.

e.g docker stop silly_sammet  
silly_sammet

5. To remove a stopped or exited container completely so that it doesnt remain lying around consuming space 

docker rm silly_sammet
silly_sammet

â€¢ run the docker ps -a command to confirm it is no longer present

6. to see the list of images and their sizes on our host

docker images
