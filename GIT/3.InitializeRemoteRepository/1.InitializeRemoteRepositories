1. Popular platform for remote repository
-Github
-GitLab
-Bitbucket
2.Once we successfully initialize a repository on one of these platforms , we get access to something called as connection string.
3. A connection string is a url that we can use in order to let Git know where the remote repository is located

e.g https://github.com/PankajSAgarwal/Devops.git

4. We can add a remote repository to our local project with git remote add command.We want to add a remote repository and give it an alias origin

git remote add origin https://.../.../[name].git

. A name for the remote
. Can have multiple remotes

5. To list all remote repositories

$ git remote -v

origin https://.../.../[name].git (fetch)
origin https://.../.../[name].git (push)
