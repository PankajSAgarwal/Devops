1. How many PODs exist on the system?


Ans : Run the command 'kubectl get pods' and count the number of pods.

No resources found in default namespace is output if no pods.

2. Create a new pod with the NGINX image

Ans: Run the command 'kubectl run nginx --image=nginx'

output : pod/nginx created

3.How many pods are created now?

Ans: Run the command 'kubectl get pods' and count the number of pods.


output: 

NAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
newpods-4256k   1/1     Running   0          23s
newpods-b45g9   1/1     Running   0          23s
newpods-nwv84   1/1     Running   0          23s
nginx           1/1     Running   0          47s

4. What is the image used to create the new pods?


You must look at one of the new pods in detail to figure this out

Ans : Run the command 'kubectl describe pod newpod-' or 'kubectl get pods -o wide' and look under the containers section.

5. Which nodes are these pods placed on?

You must look at all the pods in detail to figure this out

Ans: Run the command 'kubectl describe pod newpod-' and look under the containers section.

6. How many containers are part of the pod 'webapp'?

Note: We just created a new POD. Ignore the state of the POD for now.

Ans: Run the command 'kubectl describe pod webapp' and look under the Containers section.

2 Containers , nginx and agentz as shown below

7. What images are used in the new 'webapp' pod?

You must look at all the pods in detail to figure this out

Run the command 'kubectl describe pod webapp' and look under the containers section.


Ans: kubectl describe pod webapp

nginx and agentx

8. What is the state of the container 'agentx' in the pod 'webapp'?

Wait for it to finish the 'ContainerCreating' state

Run the command 'kubectl describe pod webapp' and look under the containers section.

Ans: waiting or error

 agentx:
    Container ID:
    Image:          agentx
    Image ID:
    Port:           <none>
    Host Port:      <none>
    State:          Waiting
      Reason:       ImagePullBackOff
    Ready:          False
    Restart Count:  0
    Environment:    <none>

9. Why do you think the container 'agentx' in pod 'webapp' is in error?

Try to figure it out from the events section of the pod

Hint: Run the command 'kubectl describe pod webapp' and look under the events section.

Ans: A docker image with this name does not exist in the Docker Hub

Events:
  Type     Reason     Age                   From               Message

  Warning  Failed     2m54s (x20 over 8m)   kubelet, node01    Error: ImagePullBackOff

10. What does the READY column in the output of the 'kubectl get pods' command indicate?

Hint: Run the command 'kubectl get pods'.

controlplane $ kubectl get pods
NAME            READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
newpods-4256k   1/1     Running            0          16m
newpods-b45g9   0/1     Completed          0          16m
newpods-nwv84   1/1     Running            0          16m
nginx           1/1     Running            0          17m
webapp          1/2     ImagePullBackOff   0          10m


Ans: Running Containers  in Pod/ Total no of conatiners in Pod

11. Delete the 'webapp' Pod.

Once deleted, wait for the pod to fully terminate.

Hint: Run the command 'kubectl delete pod webapp'.


Ans: kubectl delete pod webapp

pod "webapp" deleted

12. Create a new pod with the name 'redis' and with the image 'redis123'


Use a pod-definition YAML file. And yes the image name is wrong!

Name: redis
Image Name: redis123

Hint:Create a pod definition YAML file and use it to create a POD or use the command kubectl run redis --image=redis123.

redis.yaml
-----------
apiVersion: v1
kind: Podmetadata:
  name: redis
  labels:
    env: production
spec:
  containers:
    - name: redis
      image: redis123



controlplane $ kubectl create -f redis.yaml
pod/redis created

13. Now fix the image on the pod to 'redis'.

Update the pod-definition file and use 'kubectl apply' command or use 'kubectl edit pod redis' command.


Name: redis
Image Name: redis

Ans: controlplane $ kubectl edit pod redis
pod/redis edited
