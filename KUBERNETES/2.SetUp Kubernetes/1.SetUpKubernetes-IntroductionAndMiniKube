1. Minikube and Microk8s - These are solution for developers or those who just want to play around and learn kubernetes 

2. Kubadm - The Kubeadm tool is used to bootstrap and manage production-grade kubernetes clusters.

3. There are also hosted solution available for setting up kubernetes in a cloud environment like GCP,AWS or azure.

4. Minikube - easiest way to get started with kubernetes on a local system.

5. Earlier we discussed different components of kubernetes that make up master and worker nodes such as the API server,etcd key-value store ,controllers and scheduler on the master and the kubelets and container runtime on the worker nodes.It will take up a lot of time to set up all of these components on different systems individually by ourselves. Minikubes bundles all of these different components into a single image providing us a pre-configured single-node Kubernetes cluster so we can get started quickly.

• </> kubelet
• </> kube-apiserver
• etcd
• node-controller
• replica controller
• Container runtime
• Minikube

The whole bundle is packaged into an ISO image and its available online for download

Minikube provides an executable commandline utility that will automatically download the ISo and deploy in virtualization platform like Oracle VirtualBox or VMWare Fusion.

So you must have a hypervisor installed on your system. For Windows you can use VirtualBox or Hyperv and for linux you can use VirtualBox or KVM.

Finally to interact with the kubernetes cluster , you must have kubectl Kubernetes command line tool installed.

So u need 3 things installed in ur system.
• Hypervisor
• kubectl utility
• Minikube executable
