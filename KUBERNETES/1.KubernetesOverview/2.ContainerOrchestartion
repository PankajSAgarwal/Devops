1. The whole process of automatically deploying and managing containers(scaling up or down) is known as Container Orchestration.

2. Kubernetes is a container Orchestration technology .
There are many such technology. Docker has its own tool called Docker Swarm, Kubernetes from Google and MESOS from Apache.

3. Kubernetes is now supported on major cloud service providers like AWS,GCP and Azure.

4. Advantages of Container Orchestration

- Your application is now highly available as hardware failures do not bring your application down because we have multiple instances of application running on different nodes.

- The user traffic is load balanced across the various containers. When demand increases , deploy more instances of the applications seamlessly and within a matter of seconds .And we have the ability to do that at a service level when we run out of hardware resources, scale the number of underlying nodes up or down without having to take down the application and do all of these easily with a set of declarative object configuration files
5. Kubernetes is a container orchestration technology used to orchestrate the deployment and management of hundreds and thousands of containers in a clustered environment.
