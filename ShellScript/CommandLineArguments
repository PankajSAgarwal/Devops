1. From within a script, you can access the command run by the user using a special set of built in variables. The command run by the user is split into multiple parts and each part is stored in a built-in variable starting with the number 0.

2. The command itself is available at $0.The second part of the command is stored in a built-in variable $1

3. Best Practices

- Design your script to be re-usable
- Script should not require to be edited before running
- Use command line arguments to pass inputs.

3. script

mission_name=$1
mkdir $mission_name

rocket-add $mission_name
rocket-start-power $mission_name

rocket-internal-power $mission_name
rocket-start-sequence $mission_name
rocket-start-engine $mission_name
rocket-lift-off $mission_name

rocket-status $mission_name

$ create-and-launch-rocket jupiter-mission

4. another version of above script


mkdir $1

rocket-add $1
rocket-start-power $1

rocket-internal-power $1
rocket-start-sequence $1
rocket-start-engine $1
rocket-lift-off $1

rocket-status $1

rocket_status=$(rocket-status $1)
echo "Status of launch : $rocket_status"
