1. RPM - Red Hat Package Manager

e.g Redhat,CentOS,Fedora etc.

2. File extensions for packages managed by RPM is .rpm .

3. Five basic modes of operations of RPM are :

- Installing
- Uninstalling
- Upgrade
- Query
- Verifying

4. To install a package

rpm -ivh <<package name>>

e.g rpm -ivh telnet.rpm

5. To uninstall a package

rpm -e telnet.rpm

6. To upgrade an existing package

rpm -Uvh telnet.rpm

7. The RPM database stores information about all rpm packages installed in your system.
It is stored in the /war/lib/rpm directory

It is used to query what packages are installed, what version each package is, and any changes to any files in the package since installation.

8. to query the rpm database to get details about an installed package

rpm -q telnet.rpm

9. Verifying a package

rpm -Vf <<path to file>>

10. It is important to note that RPM does not resolve package dependencies on its own.This is why we make a higher level package manager called YUM.

11. YUM - Yellowdog,Updater ,Modfied and it is a free and open source package manager

• RPM based distros
• YUM works with software repositories which are essentially a collection of packages and provide package and dependency management
The repository information is stored in /etc/yum.repos.d and the repository files have a .repo extension.
• YUM acts as a high level package manager but under the hood it still relies on RPM to manage packages on Linux system.
• Unlike RPM , YUM handles package dependencies very well.

12. for redhat system with redhat subscription, the official redhat managed software repository is located at

/etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo

you can add a new repo in case you dont want to make use of official repo

/etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo

13. sequence of steps involved while installing the package

e.g yum install httpd

- Yum first runs a transaction check
- If the package is not installed in the system, yum checks the configured repository under the repos.d directory for the availability of the requested package. It also checks if any of the dependent packages are already installed in the system, or if it needs to be upgraded.

14. To show  all the repos added to your system, 

yum repolist

15. If you want to check which package should be installed for a specific command to work 

yum provides <<command name>>

e.g yum provides scp

16. to remove a installed package

yum remove httpd

17. To update an existing package

yum update <<package name>>
e.g yum update telnet
