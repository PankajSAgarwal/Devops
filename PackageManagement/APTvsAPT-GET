1. APT better than APT-GET
2. In most new debian system , APT is installed by default
3. apt install firefox 

provides just enough output in a user friendly format

apt-get install firfox

provides a verbose output and not in a user friendly format

4. you can search for a package using apt , but u cannot search for a package using apt-get. You have to use another tool called apt-cache.

[~] apt search telnet
[~] apt-cache search telnet // used with apt-get
