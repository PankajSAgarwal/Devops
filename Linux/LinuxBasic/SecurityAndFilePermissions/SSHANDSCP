1. SSH - used to login and execute commands on a remote computer.

• ssh <hostname or IP Address>
• ssh <user>@<hostname or IP Address>
• ssh -l <user> <hostname or IP Address>

- remote server should have ssh services running on port 22

- password-less ssh

• first generate key pair on the client

key pair = Private key + Public key

- private key is the key only you as the client will have and is not shared with anyone else.

- Public key can be shared with others including our remote server.

• when the public key is installed on the remote server, u can unlock it by connecting to it with a client that alreay has the private key.

- Set up password-less keys

• create key pair on the client using ssh-keygen command

ssh-keygen -t rsa

public key is stored at /home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

private key is stored at /home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa

• Next step is to copy the public key to the remote server
Make use of ssh-copy-id command

[~]$ ssh-copy-id bob@devapp01

• So now public key of the client is copied to remote server devapp01

these keys are installed in a specific file called authorized_keys on remote server at below location

/home/bob/.ssh/authorized_keys

2. SCP - allows you to copy data over ssh

scp /home/bob/caleston-code.tar.gz devapp01:/home/bob

• to copy the directories instead of files use -r and preserve the ownership and permission of the source file use -p flag

scp -pr /home/bob/media/ devapp01:/home/bob
