1. A new directory called sports has been created in your home directory. Inspect it.

What is the permission set for the owner of this directory?

Run: ls -ld /home/bob/sports and look at the permissions set for the owner.
rwx means the owner has full permissions to read, write and execute
2. What is the permission set for group users for the same directory sports?
Run: ls -ld /home/bob/sports and look at the permissions set for the group.
r-x means the group has permissions to read and execute
3. A new file called soccer has been created under the sports directory.

It has full permissions, update the file so that the group and others only have read and execute permissions

use: chmod 755 /home/bob/sports/soccer or chmod go-w /home/bob/sports/soccer
or any other varaition of the chmod command to get to the desired result

4. Now, add back the write permission for group and remove all permission for others for the same file called soccer
use: chmod 770 /home/bob/sports/soccer or chmod g+w,o-rwx /home/bob/sports/soccer
or any other varaition of the chmod command to get to the desired result.

5. Now, change the ownership of the file called soccer to the service account called mercury

Use: sudo chown mercury /home/bob/sports/soccer


6. We have created another file in the sport directory. Change the ownership for the entire sports directory including all the files inside to the service account mercury


Try to do this with one single command. Explore the -R recursive flag with the chown command.

run: sudo chown -R mercury /home/bob/sports
