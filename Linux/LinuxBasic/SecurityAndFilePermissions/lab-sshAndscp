1. Which port number does the SSH service use by default?

SSH makes use of port 22.
You can also validate this by running netstat -ntlp | grep ssh on a server running SSH service.
We learn more about netstat in the upcoming section.

2. If you run ssh devapp01 in the terminal, which user are you using to connect to the server?


If unsure, try it out on the terminal.

If no user is specified with the ssh command, the connection will be attempted with the logged-in user which is bob


3. First, generate the SSH key-pair using the ssh-keygen command.

Key Type RSA

ssh-keygen -t rsa   // dont use sudo as the key gen is for user bob

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:LdSmcpep5ooKlkkuniA4z+OmzO/lZMjk/jRuxZT21K4 bob@caleston-lp10
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|                 |
|         .       |
|        o +      |
|       = = +     |
| . .  = S *      |
|+ * .  = = .     |
|B= + *. o .      |
|O== Bo.o E       |
|.OB*++...        |
+----[SHA256]-----+

4. The public key created using the previous command is:

SSH keys are created under .ssh directory under the home directory.
The public key has an extension of .pub

/home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

5. Copy the public key to target server devapp01.


Make use of ssh-copy-id

run: ssh-copy-id bob@devapp01
Enter the password when prompted.

/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys

6. Which file on the target server is the public key copied in to?


The public key is added to the authorized_keys file under /home/bob/.ssh directory


7. Finally, copy the file /home/bob/caleston-code.tar.gz from Bob's laptop to the server devapp01

Copy the file to Bob's home directory.

run: scp /home/bob/caleston-code.tar.gz devapp01:/home/bob
