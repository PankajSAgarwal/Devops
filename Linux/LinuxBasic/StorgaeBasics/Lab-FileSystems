1. Which of the following filesystems does not use a journal

Ans: EXT2 does not use a journal and hence has longer recovery boot time


2. Out of the disks /dev/vdc and /dev/vdd, which one has a filesystem created?

/dev/vdc is mounted at /mnt/backups . This is only possible if it has a filesystem.

Ans: Run: sudo blkid /dev/vdc

/dev/vdc: UUID="0a12c223-459c-4dac-b928-754f89a2268a" TYPE="ext2"

3. Create an ext4 filesystem on the disk /dev/vdb and mount it at /mnt/data

Ans: 
Run: sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb
sudo mkdir /mnt/data
sudo mount /dev/vdb /mnt/data

4. What would happen to the mount /mnt/data after a system reboot

The mount is not persistent in FSTAB yet. If the system is rebooted, the filesystem will not be mounted

5. Make the mount persistent across reboot.

Use rw option with the dump and pass numbers both set to 0

Add it in the FSTAB
sudo vi /etc/fstab
Add the line /dev/vdb /mnt/data ext4 rw 0 0
Save and Exit.
