1. Is LVM installed on this machine?

Try out commands such as pvdisplay or lvs
2. Install LVM on this machine
Run sudo apt update and the sudo apt install lvm2 -y

3. Now that LVM is installed, you will find that a physical volume has already been created.

What is the name of this volume?
Ans: Run: pvdisplay

4. What is the size of this physical volume?

5. What is the name of the volume group created using this PV?

Ans: Run: pvdisplay or vgdisplay

6. Now, we will create a new VG. To do this we will make use of the disks /dev/vdc and /dev/vdd

What are the size of these disks individually?
Ans : Run: lsblk and inspect the size of disks. Each disk is of size 20G

7. Create PV's using /dev/vdd and /dev/vdc.
Ans: Run: pvcreate /dev/vdd and pvcreate /dev/vdc


8. Create a new volume group called caleston_vg using the newly created PV's


Run: sudo vgcreate caleston_vg /dev/vdd /dev/vdc
9.Create a new logical volume called data from the caleston_vg.

Size of the volume should be 10GB

Ans: Run: sudo lvcreate -L 10G -n data caleston_vg

10. Create an ext4 filesystem on this logical volume and mount it at /mnt/media

Ans: Run: sudo mkdir /mnt/media
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/caleston_vg-data
sudo mount /dev/mapper/caleston_vg-data /mnt/media

11. Resize the logical volume to 30GB
Do not unmount the filesystem.


Ans : Run: sudo lvresize -L +20G -n /dev/mapper/caleston_vg-data
sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/caleston_vg-data
