1. We will export directories on the NFS Server called nfs-lab-server and mount them on Bob's laptop.

To access this Server, run ssh nfs-lab-server, Bob's default password is: caleston123

2. How many NFS mounts are available on Bob's laptop right now?
Run: mount and look for NFS filesystems.
mount | grep -w nfs

3. SSH to the nfs-lab-server and inspect the /etc/exports.

Bob's password is caleston123

4. How many directories are defined for export in the /etc/exports file in nfs-lab-server?
Ans:
sudo cat /etc/exports and count the number of directories defined.
The lines beginning with a # are comments.

5. Try mounting the /software/repos directory on Bob's laptop at the mountpoint /mnt/data

Are you able to mount?
Remember: The mount command should be run on the client=caleston-lp10

Ans: Run: sudo mount 172.16.238.101:/software/repos /mnt/data or
mount nfs-lab-server:/software/repos /mnt/data

6. Why are you not able to mount the directory when it's defined in the /etc/exports file on nfs-lab-server?

The mount command should be run on the client=caleston-lp10

Ans : The directory has not been exported yet. We will use exportfs in the next question to export it.


7. Back on the nfs-lab-server export the directory /software/repos to Bob's laptop.


Use the export definition in the /etc/exports file.

Ans: On nfs-lab-server, run: sudo exportfs -a


8. Try to mount the directory /software/repos again on Bob's laptop at /mnt mount point.

Run: sudo mount 172.16.238.101:/software/repos /mnt .
Mount should be run on the client machine
