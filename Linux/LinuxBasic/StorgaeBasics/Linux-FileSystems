1. Partitioning alone does not make a disk usbale in OS.
2. The disks and the partitions are seen by the linux kernel as a raw disk.
3. To write a disk or partition, we must create a filesystem.
4. The file system defines how data is stored on a disk.
5. After creating a file system,we must mount it into a directory, and that's when we can read or write data to it.
6. EXT2                                         EXT4
• 2 TB file size                              • 2 TB File size
• 4 TB volume size                            • 4 TB Volume size
• Supports compression                        • Uses Journal  
• Supports Linux permissions                  • Backwards Compatibile
• Long Crash Recovery

7. The significant difference between the two file system EXT2 and EXT4 is that, in EXt2 in case of an unclean shutdown such as the one caused by a power outage , it can take quite some time for the system to boot back up. 

EXT3 file system , however , did not have this drawback. It implemented additional features that allowed quicker start up after an ungraceful shutdown.

8. EXT4 further improves the EXT3 file system, and is still one of the most common general purpose file system used today.

9. EXT4

- 16 TB file size
- 1 Exabyte
- Uses journal
- Uses checksum for Journal
- Backwards compatibile

10. An EXT4 file system can be mounted as EXt3 or EXT2 file system, and similarily EXt3 can be mounted as EXT2.

11. Working with EXT4

- We will make use of /dev/sdb disk to create a EXT4 file system.
- run the mkfs.ext4 command with the device path as the argument
[~]$ mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
[~]$ mkdir /mnt/ext4
[~] mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/ext4

- we can check if the file system is mounted by running df command or mount command.

[~]$ df -hP | grep /dev/sdb1
[~]$ mount | grep /dev/sdb1

- To make this mount available after system reboots, add an entry in the /etc/fstab
# <file system> <mount point> <type>      <options>                     <dump>  <pass>
/dev/sdb1         /             ext4  defaults,realtime,errors=panic  0   1       ~


FIELD                                     Purpose

File System                 Such as /dev/vdb1 to be mounted
MountPoint                  Directory to be mounted on
Type                        Example ext2,ext3,ext4
Options                     Such as RW= Read-Write, RO = Read-Only
Dump                        0 = ignore, 1 = take backup
pass                        0 = ignore,1 or 2 = FSCK file system check enforced

echo "/dev/sdb1   /mnt/ext4   EXT4    rw  0   0" >> /etc/fstab
