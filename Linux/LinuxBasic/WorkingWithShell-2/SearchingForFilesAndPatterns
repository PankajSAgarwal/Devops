1. find a file city.txt

locate city.txt

• The downside of this command is this depends on a database called "mlocate.db" for querying the file name.If you have just installed linux or if the file you are trying to locate was created recently, this command may not yield useful results. This is because it is possible that the DB has not been updated yet.

[~] $ updatedb

• to run updatedb command root user access is needed

2. find

find /home/michael -name City.txt

3. To serach within files most popular command is grep

[~] $ cat sample.txt

## contents of sample.txt file
This is the first line.
Followed by the second line.
And then the third line.
The fourth line has CAPITAL LETT́ERS
The fifth line does not want to be printed.

• [~] $ grep second sample.txt

o/p: Followed by the second line.

- grep command is case sensitive and will only print the lines matching the case of the pattern.

- To search case insensitive use the -i flag
  
• [~] $ grep capital sample.txt

o/p : no lines as grep is case sensitive

• grep -i capital sample.txt

o/p: The fourth line has CAPITAL LETT́ERS

- Use grep -r to search for a pattern recursively with in a directory

• [~] $ grep -r "third line" /home/michael

o/p: ./sample.txt: And then the third line.

4. To print the lines that dont match the pattern using grep

- grep -v list all lines that do not contain a particular string.

• [~] $ grep -v "printed" sample.txt

This is the first line.
Followed by the second line.
And then the third line.
The fourth line has CAPITAL LETTERS

- What if you want to match a pattern that forms the whole words

e.g 

[~] cat examples.txt

## contents of examples.txt
grep examples
linux exam on 19th

[~]$ grep exam examples.txt

o/p : grep examples
      linux exam on 19th
• To search for the whole word exam use grep -w

[~] $ grep -w exam examples.txt

o/p - linux exam on 19th

- to reverse the search and print all lines of examples.txt that doesnot match the whole word exam use grep -wv

grep -vw exam examples.txt

o/p: grep examples

5. To print a number of lines after and before matching a pattern

[~] $ cat premier-league-table.txt

## contents of premier-league-table.txt file
1 Arsenal
2 Liverpool
3 Chelsea
4 Manchester City

- To see the club that finished one ranking lower than Arsenal at the first spot

• [~] $ grep -A1 Arsenal premier-league-table.txt

o/p : 1 Arsenal
      2 Liverpool

-> This will print the lines matching the pattern and one line immediately below

- To see the club that finished before 4th spot

• [~] $ grep -B1 4 premier-league-table.txt

o/p : 3 Chelsea
      4 Manchester City

- grep -A and grep -B can be combined together to print a number of line before and after a match

• [~] $ grep -A1 -B1 Chelsea premier-league-table.txt

o/p : 2 Liverpool
      3 Chelsea
      4 Manchester City
