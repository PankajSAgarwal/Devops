1. Name resolution - translating a hostname to a ip address .

2. ping might not always be a reliable tool for name resolution . nslookup and dig are some other useful tools for name resolution.

3. DNS - a common server where all the mapping between name and ip address is stored . So all hosts on a network can use the DNS server for name resolution instead of using tehor own /etc/hosts file

4. Every host has a DNS resolution configuration file at /etc/resolv.conf

[~]$ cat /etc/resolv.conf

nameserver 192.168.1.100

5. In case a name server entry is in local host and in DNS server , the system first looks at local host and the DNS . If system find the name server in local host it uses that. However this order can be changed . This order is defined in /etc/nsswitch.conf

[~]$ cat /etc/nsswitch.conf

hosts:        files dns

â€¢ order above is first file(refers to host file) and then DNS 

6. Domain names

www.google.com.

. -> Root
.COM - Top level domain name
google - Domain name
www - sub domain name

other sub domains of google.com are mail, drive,maps,apps

e.g google maps services are at subdomain maps.google.com

google storage services are at subdomain drive.google.com

google mobile app services are available at apps.google.com

google email services are available at mail.google.com

7. To resolve domain name by its first name with in an organization

e.g if i want to just search web.mycompany.com by the name web , then i can add the following in /etc/resolv.conf in my local host

[~]$ cat >> /etc/resolv.conf

nameserver 192.168.1.100
search     mycompany.com  prod.mycompany.com

8. nslookup - query a hostname from a DNS server . nslookup does not consider the entries in the local /etc/hosts file.

[~]$ nslookup www.google.com 

9. DIG - is another useful tool to test DNS name resolution.It returns more details in a similar form as is stored on the server.
