1. What is the IP Address assigned to Bob's Laptop?

Run: ip a and check the IP address assigned (besides the localhost 127.0.0.1)

Ans: output of ip a

bob@caleston-lp10:~$ ip a1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
8: eth0@if9: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default    link/ether 02:42:ac:10:ee:bb brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet 172.16.238.187/24 brd 172.16.238.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
12: eth1@if13: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default
    link/ether 02:42:ac:10:ef:bb brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet 172.16.239.187/24 brd 172.16.239.255 scope global eth1
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

2. What is the name of the interface that has this IP (from the previous question) address assigned?

Run: ip a and check the interfaces to which the IP's is assigned or
Run: ip link

Ans: output of ip link command

bob@caleston-lp10:~$ ip link
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group defaultqlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
8: eth0@if9: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default
    link/ether 02:42:ac:10:ee:bb brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
12: eth1@if13: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default
    link/ether 02:42:ac:10:ef:bb brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0

network interfaces are eth0 and eth1

3. what is the default gateway configured in the system

Run: ip r and check the GW assigned to default route.
It should be 172.16.238.1

Ans : output of ip r command

bob@caleston-lp10:~$ ip r

default via 172.16.238.1 dev eth0
172.16.238.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 172.16.238.187
172.16.239.0/24 dev eth1 proto kernel scope link src 172.16.239.187

So gateway configured at 172.16.238.1

4. We have an apache which should be accessible on devapp01-web.
This server runs on port 80 on the server and should be accessible from Bob's laptop.

However, something seems to be wrong with the network!
Check if you are able to connect to the HTTP port 80 on the server devapp01-web from Bob's laptop?


Run a Telnet port 80 on devapp01-web to test.

Run: telnet devapp01-web 80 and check if it's successful.


Ans: No

5. Are you able to ping devapp01-web server?


Run: ping devapp01-web



Ans: No

6. Luckily, this webserver has two interfaces. The second interface is on another network and is identified by the name devapp01. Check if you are able to ping devapp01


Is ping working now?

Run: ping devapp01

Ans: Yes

7. Let's troubleshoot from the other end. SSH to the webserver by running ssh devapp01


Use Bob's default password: caleston123

8. Inspect the interface eth0 on devapp01, is it UP?


run: ip link and look at the status of the interface starting with eth0


Ans : ssh to devapp01 from Bob's laptop and then run ip link command

output of ip link

bob@devapp01:~$ ip link
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group defaultqlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
10: eth0@if11: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default
    link/ether 02:42:ac:10:ee:0a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
14: eth1@if15: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default
    link/ether 02:42:ac:10:ef:0a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0

So eth0 is in down mode

9. Bring up the eth0 interface


run: sudo ip link set dev eth0 up

10. While we are at it, there is also a missing default route on the server devapp01.

Add the default route via eth0 gateway.

Run: sudo ip r add default via 172.16.238.1


Ans: bob@devapp01:~$ sudo ip r add default via 172.16.238.1
