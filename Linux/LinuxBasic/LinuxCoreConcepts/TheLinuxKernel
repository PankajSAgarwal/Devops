1. Kernel is the core inetrface between a computer's hardware resources and its applications/process. 

2. Linux kernel performs 4 major tasks:
a. Memory management
b. Process management
c. Device drivers
d. System calls and Security

3. Linux kernel is monolitic . This means that kernel caaries out CPU scheduling , memory management and several other operations by itself.
4. Linux kernel is modular as well . it means it can extend its capabilities through the use of dynamically loading kernel modules

4. uname - displays information about kernel
[~] $ uname 
Linux

5. To pront the kernel version 

[~]$ uname -r // uname -a
4.15.0-72-generic

4 - Kernel version
15 - Major version
0 - Minor version
72 - patch release
Generic - Distro Specific Information

6. https://kernel.org - source code for liunux kernel

7. One of the major task of linux kernel is memory management

- Memroy divided into two spaces - Kernel space and User space . These are synonymous with kernel and user mode

- Kernel space is the area of the memory where kernel execute and provides services. A process running in kernel space has un-restricted access to hardware as such it is strictly reserved for running the kernel code , kernel extensions and most device drivers.

- All process running outside of kernel space resides in user space which has restricted access to CPU and memory

- User programs gets access to data stored in memory or disks by making special calls called system calls to kernel.e.g allo of memory using variable or opening a file

e.g cat /etc/os-release - opens a file to see the kernel version 
other examples of system calls are 

• open()
• close()
• readdir()
• strlen()
• closedir()
