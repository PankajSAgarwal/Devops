1. Every object in linux can be considered as a type of file
2. 3 types of files
- Regular File
- Directory File
- Special Files

3. Special files can be sub-categorized into 5 types

a. Character files - These files represents devices under /dev file system that allows the OS to communicate to IO devices serially. e.g include devices such as mouse and keyboard.

b. Block files - These are files representing block devices also located under /dev file system. A block device reads from and writes to the device in blocks or a chunk of data.E.g of block devices are HardDisk and RAM.

c. Links - Links in Linux is a way to associate two or more file names to the same set of file data.There are two types of links.

i. The hard link - associate two or more file names that share the same block of data on the physical disk.Although they behave as independent files , deleting one link will delete the data.
ii. The Symbolic link or the symlink can be loosely compared to a shortcut in Windows.
They act as pointers to another files . Deleting a symlink does not affect the data in the actual file.

d. Socket files - A socket is a special file that enables the communication between two processes .

e. Named pipes - This is a special type of file that allows connecting one process as an input to another. The data flow in a pipe is uni directional from the first process to the second.

4. How to identify different types of files in Linux

a. use of file command

[~] $ file /home/michael

output : /home/michael/: directory

b. ls -ld /home/michael
