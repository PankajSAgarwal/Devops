1. dmesg - a tool used to display messages from an area of kernel called the ring buffer.

 <i>syntax :</i>

 [~] $ dmesg

 [~] $ dmesg | gerp -i usb

 2. udevadm info - queries the udev database for device information
 syntax:
[~] $ udevadm info --query=path --name=/dev/sda5

3. udevadm monitor - listens to the kernel uevents, upon detecting an event , it prints the details,such as the device path and the device name on teh screen.
Quite handy to determine the details of a newly attached or removed device.

4. lspci - lists information about all PCI devices that are configured in the system. 

e.g PCI devices are ethernet cards , raid controllers,video cards and wireless adapters that are directly attached to PCI slots in the motherboard of the computer.

Major Number            Device type

1                         RAM
3                       HARD DISK or CD ROM
6                       Parallel printers
8                       SCSI DISK

6. lscpu - to display information about cpu architecture 
<b> Total number of virtual CPUs  = Sockets * Cores * Threads</b>
i.e if socket =1 , cores per socket = 4 and threads per core = 2 , 
total no of cpus = 1*4*2 = 8

so such a system will be able to run 8 parallel threads.

7.lsmem - can be used to list the available memory in the system.

[~] $ lsmem --summary

8. free - command to see total vs used memory in the system

-k - to display memory usage in KB.
-g - to display memory usage in GB.
